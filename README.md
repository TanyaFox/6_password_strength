# Password Strength Calculator

This is just a simple calculator to analize the strength of your password.
There are all criterions and points for each of them:
- password length > 4, but < 6 gives 1 point; password length more than 6 characters gives 2 points;
- the use of both upper-case and lower-case letters gives 2 points;
- inclusion of one or more numerical digits gives 2 points;
- inclusion of special characters gives 2 points;
- prohibition of passwords that match the format of calendar dates, license plate numbers, telephone numbers, or other common numbers gives also 2 points.

In order to use this script, just run it and enter your password.
